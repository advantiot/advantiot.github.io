                  Before embarking on a flying journey, real or on a simulator or with model airplanes, it is useful to have a basic understanding of the principles governing flight. This section provides an explanation of the fundamental laws of physics governing the forces acting on an airplane in flight, and what effect these natural laws and forces have on the performance characteristics of airplanes. There are four people to who we owe our power of flight, two scientists and two engineers!

                    In the 17th century, the famous philosopher and mathematician, Sir Isaac Newton, propounded three basic laws of motion. Almost everything known about motion goes back to his three simple laws. These laws, named after Newton, are as follows: 
                  </div>
                </div>

                  <p class="comic-neue fs-6 fw-bold">
                    <strong>Newton’s First Law of Inertia</strong> states, in part, that: a body at rest tends to remain at rest, and a body in motion tends to remain moving at the same speed and in the same direction.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This simply means that, in nature, nothing starts or stops moving until some outside force causes it to do so. This is referred to as the inertia of an object.  An airplane at rest on the ground will remain at rest unless a force strong enough to overcome its inertia is applied. Once it is moving, on the ground or in the air, its inertia keeps it moving, subject to the various other forces acting on it. These forces may speed up its motion, slow it down, or change its direction. 
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 text-center">
                  <p class="comic-neue fs-6 fw-bold">
                    <strong>Newton’s Second Law</strong> implies that: When a body is acted upon by a constant force, its resulting acceleration (rate of increase in speed) is inversely proportional to the mass of the body and is directly proportional to the applied force.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This law is about the forces involved in overcoming Newton’s First Law of Inertia. It covers both changes in direction and speed, including starting up from rest (positive acceleration) and coming to a stop (negative acceleration, or deceleration).

                    <strong>Newton’s Third Law</strong> states that: Whenever one body exerts a force on another, the second body always exerts on the first, a force that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

                  <p>
                    In an airplane, the propeller moves and pushes back the air; consequently, the air pushes the propeller (and thus the airplane) in the opposite direction, forward. In a jet airplane, the engine pushes a blast of hot gases backward; the force of equal and opposite reaction pushes against the engine and forces the airplane forward.

                    The <strong>Earth's Atmosphere</strong> in which flight is conducted is an envelope of air that surrounds the earth. Air is a mixture of gases and has mass, weight, and indefinite shape. Air, like any other fluid, is able to flow and change its shape when subjected to even minute pressures because of the lack of strong molecular cohesion. For example, it will completely fill any container into which it is placed, expanding or contracting to adjust its shape to the limits of the container.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Though air is very light, it has mass and is affected by the attraction of gravity. Therefore, like any other substance, it has weight, and because of its weight, it has force. Since it is a fluid substance, this force is exerted equally in all directions, and its effect on bodies within the air is called <strong>pressure</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A half century after Sir Newton presented his laws, Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician, explained how the pressure of a moving fluid (liquid or gas) varies with its speed of motion. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="comic-neue fs-6 fw-bold">
                    Specifically, he stated that an increase in the speed of movement or flow of a moving fluid would cause a decrease in the pressure exerted by the fluid and conversely, a decrease in its speed of flow would cause an increase in the pressure exerted. <strong>This is the fundamental principle on which flight is based.</strong>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The cross-section of a wing is shaped like an <strong>Airfoil</strong> as shown above. When this shape moves through the air, the the distance that the airstream needs travel above is greater than what it needs to travel below, and hence it flows at a higher speed above than below. By Bernoulli's Principle, this results in a higher pressure below and a lower pressure below. This difference in pressure translates to a force that pushes the wings and the attached airplane up into the air.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These laws and scientific principles were used by the Wright Brothers to build the first ever flying machine that was the genesis of the airplanes we use so widely today. Moving a machine forward, following Newton's Laws of Motion, using the power generated by an engine, was a relatively simpler challenge. The far more complex challenge was to lift a heavier-than-air body up into the air, keep it up, and bring it back gently to the ground.

                    An airplane in flight can rotate about three axes. Axes can be considered as imaginary lines that pass through the airplane's centre of gravity. 
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Longitudinal Axis</strong>: The axis that extends lengthwise through the fuselage from the nose to the tail. The movement around this axis is referred to as the <strong>Roll</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lateral Axis</strong>: The axis that extends crosswise from wingtip to wingtip. The movement around this axis is referred to as the <strong>Pitch</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vertical Axis</strong>: The axis that passes vertically through the centre of gravity. The movement around this axis is referred to as the <strong>Yaw</strong>.</li>
                  </ul>

                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 p-4">
                  <h4>Centre of Gravity</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Centre of Gravity (CG) of a body can be considered as an imaginary point at which the entire weight of that body is assumed to be concentrated. In an airplane, the centre of gravity can be considered to be the point at which the airplane would balance (not rotate on its own across any of the axes) if it was suspend (theoretically in the case of a real airplane, but this could be demonstrated with an airplane model) at that point.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The location of the centre of gravity affects the stability of the airplane. If it is located too forward or behind lengthwise, the pitching motion will be impacted. If it is too left or right crosswise, the rolling motion will be impacted. An airplane is designed and constructed to have an optimal CG when empty. When it loaded with people and cargo, and filled with fuel, the weight and therefore the CG can be impacted. Therefore, when loading an airplane, the distribution of the weight across the airplane must be given careful consideration.

The systems are further devided into primary and secondary systems.

                    The primary control system is used by the pilot to control the movement of the airplane in flight. The primary controls are responsible for the three main movements of the airplane (pitch, roll and yaw). The three components are explained below.

                    <strong>Ailerons</strong> control the roll about the longitudinal axis. The ailerons are attached to the trailing edge of each wing. The left and right ailerons move in the opposite direction from each other to make the airplane roll. When the left aileron is pushed down (and the right gets pushed up) there is an increased force created under the left wing which causes the airplane to roll to the right. The reverse aileron positions roll the airplane to the left. Ailerons are controlled by the pilot by moving the control wheel or joystick right and left.

                    <strong>Elevators</strong> control the pitch about the lateral axis. The elevators are attached to the trailing edge of the horizontal stabiliser. Both elevators move in the same direction (up or down). When the elevators are pushed down there is an increased upward force under the horizontal stabiliser which causes the airplane to pitch down. In the reverse direction, the airplane pitches up. Elevators are controlled by the pilot by pushing the control wheel or the joystick forward (elevator up, nose down) or pulling it backward (elevator down, nose up).

                    The <strong>Rudder</strong> controls the yaw about the vertical axis. The rudder is attached to the trailing edge of the vertical stabiliser. When the rudder is pushed to the left there is an increased force that pushes the vertical stabiliser to the right, causing the airplane to yaw left. When the rudder is pushed to the right the vertical stabiliser is pushed to the left causing the airplane to yaw right. The rudder is controlled by the pilot using the left and right foot pedals.

                  <p>Four forces act on an airplane at any time whether on the ground or in flight and the relationship between the forces is important to understanding and controlling flight. The four forces are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Thrust:</strong> is the force that pushes the airplane forward. This is an artificial force generated by the propeller or the jet engines. The propeller or engines push the air backwards and by Newton's Third Law, this generates an qual and opposite force that pushes the airplane forward.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Drag:</strong> is the force that opposes the forward motion of the airplane. This is a naturally occuring force, caused by a combination of friction and the push back from the air as the airplane tries to move forward through it.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Lift:</strong> is the force that pushes the airplane upwards, allowing it to take off from the ground into the air and to climb to higher altitudes while in flight. This is an artificial force generated by moving the airfoil shaped wings through the air at a high speed, using Bernoulli's principle. 
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Weight:</strong> is the force caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth on any body. This is a naturally occuring force, the same as the weight we experience for any object.

                    By modifying the forces of thrust, drag, lift, and weight as required, pilots can achieve controlled flight for an heavier-than-air airplane. The forces work in opposing pairs, countering each other, weight and lift form one pair and drag and thrust form the other pair. Quite logically, one artificial generated force is used to counter one naturally occurring force. The interaction of the forces at various stages of flight are described below:

                    <li>
                      <strong>Taxiing (for Take Off):</strong> When the airplane is stationary on the ground and needs to start moving forward on the runway, the force holding it back is the Drag, caused mainly the friction between the wheels and the runway surface. The engines need to generate an amount of Thrust greater than the Drag to start moving forward.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Take Off:</strong> When the airplane needs to take off, leaving the ground and starting its climb up in the air, the force holding it down is the Weight of the airplane. By increasing the speed and using the control surfaces, the airplane needs to generate an amount of Lift greater than the Weight to take off.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Climbing:</strong> Once the airplane has left the ground, the Drag changes from frictional forces on the ground to the push back from the air it is flying into and some friction in the air. The engines need to continue to generate Thrust greater than the drag to keep moving forward. Since the airplane needs to climb higher, it also needs to generate an amount of Lift greater than the Weight to continue climbing.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Cruising:</strong> When the airplane reaches the desired altitude and doesn't need to climb any more, the Lift can be reduced to become equal to the Weight, so the airplane does not climb but does not descend due to the pull of the Weight either.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Landing:</strong> When the airplane needs to descend, finally coming in to land on the ground, the Lift must actually be reduced gradually so that the Weight of the airplane will slowly bring it towards the ground. The descent has to be very gradual so the Lift is still required but it just needs to be controlled so that it is just a little less than the Weight. When the airplane is descending, the gravitational force counters drag and assists forward movement, causing the airplane to pick up speed even without increasing the Thrust.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Taxiing (after Landing): </strong> Once the has landed, it is still moving quite fast and needs to slow down and come to a stop. The Thrust can now be reduced to zero and in fact, brakes need to be applied to increase the Drag (in the form of friction between the brakes and the wheels) to slow the plane down and bring it to a gradual stop. In advanced and large airplane engines, the Thrust can be reversed to help slow down the airplane faster.

                    The secondary control system supports the primary control system to assist the pilot in controlling the airplane. Secondary flight control systems consist of wing flaps, spoilers, and trim systems.

                      <strong>Flaps:</strong> are control surfaces attached to the trailing edge of the wing. They are used to increase lift, especially during take off and landing. When landing they also serve to add some drag to reduce speed. Flaps can be extended when needed and retracted into the wing’s structure when not needed. In larger airplanes flaps can be extended and retracted in steps, giving further control over the additional lift or induced drag.

                    <p></p>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Spoilers:</strong> are control surfaces attached to the top of wings to reduce lift and increase drag by "spoiling" the airflow over the wing. Spoilers are most often used to control rate of descent for accurate landings as they allows the aircraft to descend without gaining speed. Spoilers are also deployed to help reduce ground roll after landing. By destroying lift, they transfer weight to the wheels, improving braking effectiveness.

                      <strong>Trim Systems:</strong> are control surfaces attached to the primary control surfaces. When the pilot needs to maintain a straight and level flight, ideally no changes to the control surfaces should be required. However, there often small forces that cause a slight change in the airplane's direction. Instead of the pilot contantly making changes to the primary control surfaces, trim systems allow for small changes to their settings that offset the effect of the small forces, thus relieving the pilot of the effort to constantly manage the primary control surfaces. While most commonly used to maintain straight and level flight, trimming can also be used in any phase of flight, for example to maintain a constant rate of climb or descent. And, while elevator trim is the most common, trimming can also be done on the rudder and ailerons.

                    While the difference in air pressure above and below the wing does provide Lift, that is not the only contributor. The movement of the airplane (specifically the wing) at a high speed through the air generates a force that also contributes to the Lift. In fact, this is the component of Lift that is controllable by the pilot using a concept known as the <strong>Angle of Attack (AoA)</strong>. The AoA is defined as the angle between the chord line of an airfoil (the wings on an airplane) and the direction of the wind as it strikes the leading edge of the wing as can be seen from the image above.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 p-4">
                  <p>
                    The force of the wind hitting the wing at an angle produces a force that pushes the wing in a direction that is perpendicular to the angled wing. Using vector arithmetic, this force can be broken up into two components: a vertical component which is the Lift and a horizontal component which is the Drag. Using a combination of airspeed and the AoA, pilots can control the amount of Lift required depending on the stage of the flight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since flying an airplane at a certain airspeed with the wing at an angle of attack generates both Lift and Drag, increasing the AoA will not keep on increasing the Lift without limit. In fact, as the AoA is increased it not only increases the Drag component, it also spoils the airflow over the wings which further reduces the Lift. There is therefore, an optimal combination of airspeed and the AoA that generates the maximum possible Lift. Increasing the AoA any further will start to actually reduce the Lift and in fact there is a point at which increasing the AoA will reduce the Lift so much that it is not sufficient to keep the airplane in the air anymore. Similarly, reducing the airspeed too much will also result in insufficient Lift.
                  </p>

                    This condition in flight where the Lift is not sufficient to keep the airplane in the air is referred to as a Stall. The airspeed below which this occurs is referred to as the Stall Speed. The AoA above which a stall occurs is referred to as the Critical or Stall Angle of Attack. This is a dangerous condition and corrective action must be taken immediately by increasing the airspeed or reducing the AoA as required.

                  <p>Navigation is the process of planning and executing and possibly recording, the movement of a person or a vehicle from one place to another. The term vehicle includes surface (land or sea) transport such as a cars, trucks, trains and ships, as well as non-surface transport such as airplane. Successful navigation involves taking a vehicle from one place to another in a reasonable time without breaking any laws related to transport or endangering the safety of those on board or in the path of the vehicle.</p>
                  <p>Airplane and ship navigation is a lot more complex than land transport navigation primarily because there are many more visual aids to navigation on land than on sea or in the air. Air navigation is further significantly more complex for multiple reasons. Airplanes travel at relatively high speeds, leaving less time to calculate or change direction en route. Airplanes cannot stop in mid-air to ascertain their position at leisure. A surface vehicle can get lost, run out of fuel, and await rescue without significant impact, except time delays. Other than specialised military airplane, commercial or private airplane cannot run out of fuel in the air as they don't have mid-air refuelling options.</p>
                  <p>There are two main navigation modes:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Visual Flight Rules (VFR)</li>
                    <li>Instrument Fight Rules (IFR)</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 p-3">
                <h5>Visual Flight Rules (VFR)</h5>
                <p>In this form of navigation, the pilot relies on visual points of locational reference on the surface below, usually in conjunction with an aeronautical chart. This is a chart that depicts controlled airspace, radio navigation aids and airfields, as well as hazards to flying such as mountain and main-made tall structures such as radio towers or skyscrapers. It also includes sufficient ground detail including towns, roads, wooded areas, and water bodies, all of which can be used as reference points to in visual navigation. The information is regularly updated in what are known as notices to airmen, or NOTAMs. This form of navigation in an airplane is usually practiced over or close to land and under visual meteorological conditions (VMC) for flight, which are conditions in which pilots have sufficient visibility to observe the terrain they are flying over and other airplane around them.</p>
                <h5>Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)</h5>
                <p>In this form of navigation, the pilot will navigate exclusively using instruments, radio navigation aids and satellite based positioning systems, or as directed by air traffic control. This form of navigation is the only option in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), which is the opposite of VMC in that pilots do not have sufficient visibility to observe the terrain or other airplane due to weather conditions or at night. IFR can be used even when visibility is good if the pilot so desires. IFR needs radio and satellite guidance systems en-route and at airports. So pilots cannot fly under IMC in areas that do not have IFR support.</p>

                    Points along a course are referred to as Waypoints, which are intermediate points on a route at which the direction maybe changed or they may have some other purpose such as the location of an airport or air traffic control or a directional radio station. Waypoints are identified by coordinates that identify a point in physical space. For terrestrial navigation these coordinates can include longitude and latitude. Air navigation also includes altitude.
                  </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 p-4">
                  <p>The main step in navigation planning is deciding the optimal path from the origin to the destination. Generally the pilot should choose a route that will get the airplane to its destination in the shortest possible time, while taking care to avoid airspace that may be restricted or not safe to fly through due to terrain or weather conditions. The planning must also factor in the air traffic control (ATC) units to contact along the route for guidance and emergency support and the appropriate frequencies they can be contacted on.</p>
                  <p>Once the route is determined, the fuel requirement can be calculated, also taking into account the weight of the airplane and the expected altitude and cruising speed, and the wind direction. A tailwind (wind in the direction of the flight) will shorten flight time, a headwind (wind against the direction of the flight) will increase it.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the pilot should have in mind some alternative plans in case the route cannot be flown for some reason, unexpected weather conditions being the most common. At times the pilot may be required to file a flight plan for an alternate destination and to carry adequate fuel for this. The more work a pilot can do on the ground prior to departure, the easier it will be in the air.</p>
                  <p>The chosen route is plotted on the map, and the lines drawn are called the track. The aim of all subsequent navigation is to follow the planned track as accurately as possible. In VFR flight plans The pilot may often choose to follow a clearly visible feature on the ground such as a railway track, river, highway, or coastline.</p>

                    <p>Commercial airplane are not allowed to operate along a route that is out of range of a suitable place to land if an emergency such as an engine failure occurs. The ETP calculations serve as a planning strategy, so flight crews always have an option in an emergency event, allowing a safe diversion to their chosen alternate.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 p-4">
                  <h5>Alternative Routes</h5>
                  <p>Every flight plan must have an alternative airport selected for landing, and a route mapped to that airport, in case it is not possible to land at the original destination airport for any reason. For long flights, in addition the alternative to the destination, airports along the route must be identified for landing in case of emergencies on the airplane, such as equipment malfunction or failure.</p>
                  <p>For this, flight planning uses a concept known as <strong>Equal Time Point (ETP)</strong>. ETP can be the point in the flight where it would take the same time to continue flying on to the destination or return back to the departure airport. On longer flights, ETP can also be the distance between two airport options at any point if an unplanned landing is required at any point during the flight. ETP calculations are based on several parameters including the altitude, speed, wind direction, weather and equipment status (for example, if one of two engines fails).</p>
                  <p>A flight plan also has a <strong>Point of No Return (PNR)</strong>, which is the point on a flight at which a airplane has just enough fuel to return to the airport from which it departed. Beyond this point that option is closed, and the airplane must proceed to some other destination.</p>
                  <p>Generally, the origin or destination airports are the best points to land at from a convenience perspective but since safety is more important, these calculations help determine the best option keeping both in mind but prioritising safety.</p>

                  <h5>The Reference Line (Datum)</h5>
                  <p>There are four main directional references used in air navigation, depending on the datum used.</p>

                      <strong>Degrees True (ºT): Relative to True North</strong>
                      <br/>
                      True North (also referred to as Geographic North) is the direction along the Earth's surface towards the geographic North Pole. Directions measured with the line to the North Pole as the reference are referred to as True North directions. The North Pole is a fixed reference point and does not change under any conditions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Degrees Magnetic (ºM): Relative to Magnetic North</strong>
                      <br/>
                      A magnetic compass relies on the Earth's magnetic field which can be differently aligned at different locations on the Earth. Thus, the North indicated by a magnetic compass is referred to as the Magnetic North and may not be exactly aligned with True North. The difference in angle between the True North and Magnetic North reference lines is known as the Variation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Degrees Compass (ºC): Relative to Compass North</strong>
                      <br/>
                      Any magnetic or ferrous material or electrical equipment on or near an airplane compass will affect the local magnetic field and may deflect the compass needle away from the Magnetic North. The North shown by a compass at any point in time is referred to as the Compass North, which may be different from the Magnetic North. The difference in angle between the Magnetic North and Compass North reference lines is known as the Deviation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Degrees Relative (ºR): Relative to an arbitrary reference line</strong>
                      <br/>
                      This directional reference is used to determine the direction of travel with reference to a specific points, usually a radio station that is transmitting a signal, with the reference line being the line from the airplane to the station.

                    The angle between the Heading and the Track is referred to as the Drift Angle. If the Heading is set correctly, the Wind Correction Angle will be equal to the Drift Angle and the Track will be aligned with the Course, which is the perfect flight condition.<br/>
                    The angle between the Heading and the Course is referred to as the Wind Correction Angle (WCA). In a zero-wind condition, the Heading will be the same as the Course (WCA will be 0 degrees).

                      <br/>
                      The Course of an airplane is the path it intends to take to get from an origin to a destination point. For short flights it may be a straight line between the origin and destination airports. For long flights, the course may not be a straight line, rather it will be a series of connected straight lines between continuous sets of two points along the way. The goal of the pilot is to keep the airplane on the Course.

                      <strong>Heading</strong>
                      <br/>
                      The Heading of an airplane is the direction its nose is pointed towards. Airplanes in flight are subjected to wind forces that cause a change to the flight direction from the intended direction. To stay on its Course, an airplane must actually fly in a Heading that takes into factor the wind direction such that the wind forces correct the flight direction such that it actually stays on Course.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Track</strong>
                      <br/>
                      The Track is the actual path made over the ground in flight. If the Heading is set correctly, the Track will be the same as the Course. If the Heading is not corrected for the wind and is set to be aligned with the Course the wind will push the airplane in a different direction, a Track which will not be aligned with the Course. This will take the airplane away from its intended destination.
                    </li>
